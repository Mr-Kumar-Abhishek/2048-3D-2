# 2048-3D
3D variant of the game by @gabrielecirulli

This is a simple HTML5/WebGL game, compatible with Chrome (and Firefox), written in JavaScript with three.js.

### Installation
Download the archive, extract it and launch it with your favorite browser by double clicking `index.html`.

### How to play
Use arrows or `WASD` / `ZQSD` controls to move all blocks in the desired direction.

Blocks can be moved towards the camera with `C` or backwards with `E`.

When two blocks with the same color collide, they merge into a new block. Try to get as far as you can!

### Additional controls
Use your mouse (left click + move) to rotate the camera around the scene. Controls will be automatically updated.

You may also zoom with the middle mouse button.
